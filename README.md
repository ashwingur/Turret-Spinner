2D Endless Survival Game created in Unity. The scripts are very modular and there is strong use of OOP design such as inheritance to reduce code repetition. A state machine design pattern is used to encode the bosses behaviour.

Features:
* A random wave spawning system that gradually increases in difficulty
* Random boss at the end of each wave, which has a unique behaviour and various states
* Shop to upgrade various components of the player's ship (press E to open shop)
* Minimap to show the position of the player on the map
* HUD features such as health, wave, score, money and cooldowns

I have created all the artwork (except for the background planet and gas cloud). Music and sound effects are from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/).
