2D Endless Survival Game created in Unity. The scripts are very modular and there is strong use of OOP design such as inheritance to reduce code repetition. A state machine design pattern is used to encode the bosses behaviour.

I have created all the artwork (except for the background planet and gas cloud). Music and sound effects are from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/).
